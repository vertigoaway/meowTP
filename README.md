MeowTP!!!

too early to write a proper readme

client requests and recieves file(s)

server fufills requests and sends file(s)

library is general functions for meowTP both will use

default port is 6969 cause im awesome

handshake steps:
1. client sends "hand?"
2. server sends "hand" and attaches server public key
3. client sends "shake?" and attaches client public key
4. server sends "shake" encrypted as a confirmation

awful command names? yeah.
